# Bevy tryout

## Inspiration
Familiarizing with rust modules and bevy by refactoring bevy's example game [breakout](https://github.dev/bevyengine/bevy/blob/latest/examples/games/breakout.rs)

## Installation

- Launch the game with debugger/inspector
```rs
cargo run
```

- Launch the game without debugger/inspector
```rs
cargo run --no-default-features
```
